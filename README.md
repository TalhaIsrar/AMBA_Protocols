## üìä Introduction

The **Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA)** family of protocols by ARM defines **standardized interfaces** for communication between components in a System-on-Chip (SoC).  
It improves interoperability between IP cores and simplifies integration by providing well-defined **bus interfaces** for masters, slaves, and bridges.

This repository includes:

- ‚úÖ **Synchronous AHB-to-APB bridge** implementation with FSM-based control  
- ‚úÖ **Testbenches** to validate protocol behavior  
- ‚úÖ Parameterized and reusable SystemVerilog code
- ‚úÖ AHB APB Interfaces for easy future extension

## üß† AMBA Overview

The AMBA specification defines multiple bus protocols tailored to different performance and complexity requirements:

| Protocol | Purpose | Typical Use Case |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus)** | High-performance, pipelined system bus | CPU, DMA, Memory, High-speed peripherals |
| **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus)**  | Low-power, simple interface | UART, Timer, GPIO, Low-speed peripherals |
| **AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface)** | High-performance, high-frequency bus with burst and out-of-order transactions | Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, DDR controllers |

Each protocol builds upon the previous one, allowing a **hierarchical interconnect**.  
The AHB and AXI buses are typically used in **high-speed domains**, while APB is used for **low-speed peripheral access**.

## üîÑ Need for AHB-to-APB Bridge

The **AHB-to-APB bridge** acts as a protocol converter between the **high-performance AHB system bus** and the **low-power APB peripheral bus**.  
Since AHB supports pipelined, burst-based communication and APB is non-pipelined, a bridge is required to **translate transactions** while maintaining timing and data integrity.

**Key responsibilities of the AHB-to-APB bridge:**
1. Decode AHB address and generate corresponding **PSEL** for the targeted APB slave.
2. Manage **handshaking and timing** between clock domains (if `HCLK` ‚â† `PCLK`).
3. Convert AHB **read/write control signals** into APB-compliant signals.
4. Insert appropriate **wait states** to synchronize slower peripherals.

---

## üß± Bridge Architecture

The AHB-to-APB bridge consists of:
- **Address Decoder** ‚Äî Identifies which APB slave is being accessed. (Single slave in this repo so no decoding)
- **Clock Domain crossing handshake** ‚Äî Use FIFO or handshaking with synchrnoizers in case asynchrnouns bridge. (This repo has implementation of a synchrnous bridge)
- **State Machine (FSM)** ‚Äî Controls signal transitions across the two protocols.
- **Register Stage** ‚Äî Buffers data and address signals between AHB and APB domains.

### üîå Block Diagram

The following diagram shows the **connectivity and signal flow** between the AHB and APB domains through the bridge:

### ‚öôÔ∏è FSM Description

The **Finite State Machine (FSM)** manages protocol conversion between AHB and APB phases.  
It ensures correct signal sequencing for setup and enable phases of the APB, while responding appropriately to AHB transactions.

*(FSM diagram source: ARM Example AMBA System Technical Reference Manual [DDI0170])*  

**FSM States:**
1. **ST_IDLE** ‚Äì Idle state where PSEL and PENABLE are low, waiting for a valid AHB read or write transfer.
2. **ST_READ** ‚Äì Sets up an APB read transfer and asserting the appropriate PSEL.
3. **ST_WWAIT** ‚Äì Waits for AHB write data to become valid before starting the corresponding APB write transfer.
4. **ST_WRITE** ‚Äì Initiates an APB write by asserting PSEL and PWRITE, completing a single write transfer.
5. **ST_WRITEP** ‚Äì Handles a pipelined APB write while inserting a wait state to maintain AHB-APB synchronization.
6. **ST_RENABLE** ‚Äì Enables the APB read transfer by asserting PENABLE for data phase completion.
7. **ST_WENABLE** ‚Äì Enables the APB write transfer by asserting PENABLE for data phase completion.
8. **ST_WENABLEP** ‚Äì Manages pending transfers, inserting a wait state when a read follows a write to ensure proper sequencing.

## üîå Interface Description

The `ahb_to_apb_bridge` module connects an **AHB-Lite bus (slave interface)** to an **APB bus (master interface)**, translating AHB transactions into APB-compliant accesses.
The following table summarizes all signal groups and their roles:
